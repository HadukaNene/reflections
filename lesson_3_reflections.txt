When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are collaborating/working with others on a project or when you wish to work
  on files in your repo while away from your local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If you donâ€™t want to change or mess up your local originals.
