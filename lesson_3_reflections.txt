When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are collaborating/working with others on a project or when you wish to work
  on files in your repo while away from your local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If you donâ€™t want to change or mess up your local originals.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork is a Github term for cloning repos on Github. Clones are copies of repo. Branches are labels
  like Master. Use fork when forking on Github; clone to clone locally or from the cloud to local;
  and branches to label commits
