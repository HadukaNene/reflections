What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates a metadata file .git which is used to track changes. This sets
	the ball rolling for git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is different from the WD because the files in it have been added to be 
	tracked by git. Different from a repo because the files are still to be
	added to a commit. Acts as a waiting area

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Add the file to the staging area make your changes and then commit the file
